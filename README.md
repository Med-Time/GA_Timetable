A minimal one-day project that builds a timetable/class-scheduling solver using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a Streamlit GUI.

## Features
- Accepts JSON input for classes, rooms and timeslots or uses sample data
- Detects infeasible inputs (more classes than slots*rooms)
- Runs a GA to assign each class to a timeslot and room
- Visualizes the resulting timetable as a grid (rooms × timeslots)
- Exports timetable to CSV
